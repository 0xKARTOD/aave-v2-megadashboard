## Main info

Here you can find basic information about the project. Prices, holders distribution, new users, users activity, Market size, Total available, Total debt (borrowed) and LTV

## Deposit, Borrow, Flashloans, Liquidations, Stake

Utilizing a suite of smart contracts, Aave allows users to place funds into a network pool, enabling other users to access and borrow the deposited funds. All loans are backed by other crypto assets and the value of the loan is always over-collateralized by the Aave protocol.

## Governance/AIPs

The main idea of the governance is to stay abreast of the crypto market and take the project as far as possible with constant updates and adjustments to the protocol.

## Polygon

AAVE and Polygon have launched a joint campaign called #Defiforall. The goal of the campaign is to spread awareness that decentralized finance can be used by anyone regardless of their wealth or portfolio size.

## Gas price
What contributes more to gas costs? You will find the answer in this section.

Here we will look at how the AVG gas price correlates with daily counts of borrowings, deposits, term loans, and liquidations. To do this, we will use the Pearson correlation coefficient.

## AAVE and another project
Comparison of key features with other projects, such as Maker and Compound
